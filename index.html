    <h3>The Self Hurdle</h3>
        <p>
            After looking at your accomplishment you may think "This does not look like much."
            <br>Getting over those initial thoughts are hard at first, but it is important to kno that you are striving for greater.</br>

            The most important thing is to not give up or sell yourself short so to speak.
            <br>Part of becoming a developer is trial and error, failing, and trying again.</br>
            It's ok to feel overwhelmed, overcoming those insecurites makes it all the more sweeter!
